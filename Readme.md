This is the reference implementation of the models and code for the fully convolutional networks (FCNs) in the [PAMI FCN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06211) and [CVPR FCN](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/html/Long_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_2015_CVPR_paper.html) papers

##Note that this is a work that deploy FCNs on [nvidia TX1 board](http://www.nvidia.com/object/jetson-tx1-dev-kit.html)
